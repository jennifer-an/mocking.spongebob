# mocking.spongebob

### Some background
Mocking SpongeBob was a once popular meme floating around the interwebs, 
based on the classic cartoon series 
[SpongeBob SquarePants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants).

The setup is simple, to mock someone, repeat what they say but TYPe iT uP lIKe ThIS
in randomly alternating capital letters. This is accompanied with an image
of SpongeBob flapping his arms around imitating a chicken, as below.
