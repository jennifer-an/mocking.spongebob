The `mocking.spongebob` R package helps you type up a string of words in alternating captials.

### How it works
It's real easy. This is a one function one package type piece of work. 

```R
> library(mocking.spongebob)
> mocking.spongebob("This is a one function one package type piece of work.")
[1] "THIS IS a one fUNcTIon One PaCKAge TYPE pIeCE of Work."
```
